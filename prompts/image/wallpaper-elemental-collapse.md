# 🌌 Elemental Collapse – Wallpaper Prompt Builder

Design a widescreen, high-contrast wallpaper depicting a powerful symbolic
structure mid-collapse — something ancient, alien, or sacred, breaking apart
into darkness and silence. Inspired by themes of entropy, forgotten meaning, and
cosmic decay.

## 📄 Prompt Template

```
A high-contrast desktop wallpaper (16:9 aspect ratio, 2560×1440 resolution)
with a mostly black background. At the center or slightly offset, a massive
{subject} is mid-collapse — disintegrating, cracking, and unraveling into void.
The structure is made of radiant lines, fractured geometry, and arcane energy,
as if once bound by power, now slowly decaying. Fine threads, glowing filaments,
and shattered glyphs drift outward from the breakage. Sparse use of a single
highlight color (sky blue, ember red-orange, toxic green, deep violet, or molten
gold) traces through the cracks and remnants. The overall feel is ancient,
sacred, and catastrophic — like witnessing a forgotten engine of meaning come
undone. Ultra high detail, painterly or cinematic abstract realism style.
```

## 🧠 Subject Ideas ({subject})

These forms work especially well:

- ritual sigil
- monolithic alien circuit
- sacred geometric array
- planetary astrological diagram
- forgotten glyph
- symbolic machine
- decaying celestial interface
- entropy-spiral mandala
- corrupted energy core
- ancient arcane node
- (your custom subject here)

## 🎨 Style Modifiers (optional)

Feel free to add these phrases at the end of the prompt:

**Composition:**

- Off-center, left-heavy layout
- Centered like a decaying mandala
- Emerging from lower right corner
- Rotated or skewed, like it’s falling mid-space

**Decay Intensity:**

- Partially collapsed, structure still readable
- Mid-collapse with shards floating
- Nearly erased, only echoes and fragments remain
- Glowing dust scattering into void

**Lighting & Texture:**

- Backlit through the cracks
- Matte surface with glowing veins
- Glossy black like obsidian
- Charred, like burnt circuitry

## ✅ How to Use

1. Choose a {subject} from the list or define your own
2. Optionally pick 1–2 style modifiers
3. Plug into the prompt template above
4. Use it in your image generator (Midjourney, SD, etc.)
  1. If supported, add: --ar 16:9 or --w 2560 --h 1440
